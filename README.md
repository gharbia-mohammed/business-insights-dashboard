### Project Overview



This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to generate actionable business insights. The analysis covers overall sales trends, sales and profit by category, top-selling products, and high-profit but low-sales items. It also examines category-level sales contributions and key profitability drivers. Together, these insights provide data-driven recommendations to support strategic decision-making and enhance understanding of the companyâ€™s performance.
